#+TITLE: GameSketchLib

GameSketchLib is a simple game engine for [[http://processing.org][processing]]
and [[http://processingjs.org][processing-js]] inspired by [[http://flixel.org/][flixel]].

It's being developed over a [[http://www.youtube.com/user/tangentstorm][series of video lessons]] which
loosely follow SquashMonster's [[http://www.reddit.com/r/learngameprogramming/][/r/learngameprogramming]] 
course for the [[http://ureddit.com/][University of Reddit]], but (hopefully)
simplified for complete beginners to programming.
